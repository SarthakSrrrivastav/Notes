DRY expands to Don’t Repeat Yourself and this concept of having re-usable blocks of codes is very crucial for achieving abstraction in Python.


A function can be called as a section of a program that is written once and can be executed whenever required in the program, thus making code reusability.


The rules for naming a function are the same as naming a variable. It begins with either letter from A-Z, a-z in both upper & lower cases or an underscore(_). The rest of its name can contain underscores(_), digits(0-9), any letters in upper or lower case
